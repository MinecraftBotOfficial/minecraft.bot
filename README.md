***Due to the increased number of requests for Minecraft.BOT subdomains recently, with many having questionable relevancy to the JavaScript community and ecosystem, we've decided that going forward Minecraft.BOT will be focusing on accepting subdomain requests from projects with a clear relation to the Minecraft community.***

***As some examples, personal pages, blogs, and Test pages will no longer be accepted. Projects such as Minecraft servers, Minecraft Plugins, tools that have a clear and direct relation to Minecraft, will be accepted when requesting a Minecraft.BOT subdomain. This decision does not affect subdomains that have already been granted.***

**To get a short and sleek subdomain for your own GitHub Pages site follow these 4 Steps:**

### Step 1
If you haven't already, now it's time to log in to your GitHub account and set up your GitHub Pages site following the instructions [here](https://pages.github.com/). To get a head start you can simply use the generator with one of the provided themes and **add some reasonable content to your new page**.

### Step 2
Now determine your Minecraft.BOT subdomain: either choose your username or the name of your repo according to the existing GitHub Pages URL (for ```http://myserver.github.io/page```, either ```myserver.minecraft.bot``` or ```somethingnetwork.minecraft.bot``` would be possible). More details in the [wiki](https://github.com/MinecraftBotOfficial/minecraft.bot/wiki).

### Step 3
Add a file named ```CNAME``` to your repo (in the ```gh-pages``` branch for project pages) with a single line matching the domain you have chosen (e.g. ```foo.minecraft.bot```). If you prefer a webinterface form, have a look at [GitHub Pages Help](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-or-removing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/).

### Step 4
To finish the procedure, make a pull request in this GitHub repository that adds your subdomain to the [list](https://github.com/MinecraftBotOfficial/minecraft.bot/blob/master/cnames_active.js) of existing Minecraft.BOT domains. Your new URL should go live within 24 hours (keep an eye on your pull request in case of a naming conflict).

### Thanks
... to **[Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com)** for their superb DNS service that makes this possible. While Minecraft.BOT is using their free plan - to a shameless extent - they helped us more than once with some flexible solutions and extended quotas. Many thanks!
